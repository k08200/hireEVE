/**
 * The primary Google grant died and the user is still inside the app.
 *
 * This happens without any action on their part: Google returns no
 * refresh_token, the access token expires, and nothing can renew it — the
 * server reports `googleNeedsReconnect` and the background sync then fails
 * every 60 seconds forever. Someone who also connected an IMAP inbox is not
 * bounced to onboarding, so without this they are never told at all; their
 * Gmail simply stops arriving.
 *
 * Deliberately not shown on /onboarding: that page carries its own notice, and
 * two versions of the same warning on one screen reads as a fault in the app.
