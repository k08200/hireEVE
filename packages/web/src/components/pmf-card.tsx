/**
 * PMF probe — the read-and-answer surface for `product/cohort.ts` (#1234).
 *
 * That PR shipped the eligibility rules, the store and the summary, and said
 * plainly: "No UI for the probe, so nothing is collected until one exists."
 * The pricing decision in the launch plan is gated on a number this produces,
 * so every day without this is a day of eligible users walking past ungathered.
 *
 * Four properties inherited from the server, none of which may be softened:
 *
 *   1. **The server decides who is asked, not this.** Eligibility is 7 days of
 *      tenure plus 20 judged decisions, evaluated server-side and returned as a
 *      single boolean. No thresholds are duplicated here — a second copy of a
 *      rule is a second answer waiting to disagree with the first.
 *
 *   2. **Asked once.** The server refuses anyone who has already answered, and
 *      a local dismissal covers "not now" without a second write path. Nagging
 *      is how you convert a measurement into an annoyance, and an annoyed
 *      answer is worse data than no answer.
 *
 *   3. **The write does not fail open.** `POST /api/pmf/response` returns 500
 *      rather than pretending. Someone who answers and sees no error assumes
 *      they were counted; if they were not, the number the pricing decision
 *      rests on is quietly wrong. So a failure leaves the question standing and
 *      says so.
 *
 *   4. **Three options, never four.** The Sean Ellis question is only
 *      comparable because everyone asks it the same way. Adding a neutral
 *      middle or a free-text box would produce a number that looks like the
 *      benchmark and is not one.
 *
 * Renders nothing unless the server says this user is eligible — including when
 * the flag is off, which is simply `eligible: false`.
