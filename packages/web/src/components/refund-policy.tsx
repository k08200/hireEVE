        Klorn Pro is a monthly subscription at {PRO_PRICE_WEB}/month, billed through Paddle. Paddle
        is the merchant of record for these purchases: Paddle handles the payment, issues the
        receipt, and appears on your card or bank statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        New subscriptions start with a 7-day free trial. You are not charged during the trial.
        Cancel before it ends and you are never billed.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
        <li>
          <strong>Cancel anytime.</strong> Cancellation stops future renewals. Your Pro access
          continues until the end of the period you already paid for.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>14-day refund on a first paid month.</strong> If Klorn is not for you, email us
          within 14 days of your first charge and we will refund it in full — no explanation needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>After that window,</strong> paid periods are non-refundable by default, because
          access was available for the period. If something went wrong on our side — an outage, a
          failed sync, a charge you did not expect — write to us and we will make it right.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Statutory rights are unaffected.</strong> Where local consumer law grants you a
          stronger right of withdrawal or refund, that law applies and overrides this section. In
          the Republic of Korea this includes the withdrawal rights under the Act on Consumer
          Protection in Electronic Commerce.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To cancel or request a refund, email{" "}

          href={`mailto:${BILLING_CONTACT_EMAIL}`}

        </a>{" "}
        from the address on your Klorn account. Refunds are returned to the original payment method;
        the time it takes to appear depends on your bank.
      </p>
      <p>
        Klorn&apos;s free tier remains free, and the source is available under AGPL for self-hosting
        — self-hosted instances involve no billing relationship with us.
