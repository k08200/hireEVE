# Judge eval set

`judge-eval-set.json` is a **synthetic, PII-free** 56-email set used to
regression-test the judge. It is NOT the founder's private ground truth (that
file is gitignored and never leaves the machine) — it encodes the same locked
mental model. It was a 50-item, 4-tier set at introduction; #1134 dual-labelled
it for v2 and grew it to 56, and #1138 made v2 the default, so the live label
distribution is **17 QUEUE / 13 PUSH / 12 SILENT / 10 INFO / 4 MEETING**:

- **QUEUE** is the default ("I'll look at this on my own schedule")
- **SILENT** is narrow: clear marketing/promo only
- **PUSH** is urgent + confident
- **MEETING** is scheduling; **INFO** is an automated record worth keeping
- **AUTO** is not a lane — it is a per-email eligibility flag plus an
  account-level mode. The set carries **zero** truth-AUTO items, so every
  AUTO readout below is vacuous by construction, not a passing score.

## The two gates

| Gate | What runs | Where | Bar |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deterministic | fast-path + keyword fallback (no LLM, no keys) | `src/__tests__/judge-eval-set.test.ts`, every CI test run | ≥70% accuracy floor + safety invariants |
| LLM end-to-end | real provider via `judgeEmail` | `.github/workflows/eval.yml` (PRs touching judge files) or `pnpm eval:judge` | ≥80% (poc-accuracy exits 2 below it) |

Safety invariants (enforced on every run, even on misses):

1. A missed PUSH must degrade to **QUEUE** (visible), never SILENT (hidden).
2. A SILENT-labelled marketing item must never be predicted PUSH.

## Numbers at introduction (2026-06-12 — historical, 50-item 4-tier set)

- No-LLM pipeline: 39/50 = **78%**. The 11 misses are urgent-human-non-investor
  PUSH items and all AUTO items — both need LLM feature extraction, which is
  exactly why the fallback floor sits at 70%, not 80%.

## No-LLM pipeline re-measured (2026-08-26 — current 56-item v2 set)

- **46/56 = 82.1%** overall, with per-lane recall SILENT 12/12, MEETING 4/4,
  INFO 9/10, QUEUE 15/17, **PUSH 6/13 (46.2%)**.
- The fallback's weak axis is unchanged and worth stating plainly: **it does
  not reliably interrupt.** Seven of thirteen urgent items miss, because
  urgency on human mail needs LLM feature extraction. What it does hold is the
  invariant that matters — all seven misses landed in `QUEUE` and **none in
  `SILENT`** (silenced precision 12/12). Degraded mode costs the interrupt,
  never the message.
- Reproduce with no provider key configured:
  `pnpm eval:judge` (every item drops to the keyword path; the run exits 3
  INSTRUMENT DEGRADED, which is the intended signal when you are measuring the
  LLM and the correct one to ignore when you are deliberately measuring the
  fallback).

The deterministic floor is a **ratchet**: raise it when the fallback improves;
never lower it to make a PR pass.

## Model bake-off re-run (2026-08-26 — current model generation)

> **Superseded 2026-09-04** by the three-run measurement at the end of this file. The table below is a single run per model and ranks a one-email gap; keep it as history, cite the 09-04 tiers instead.

The bake-off the README quotes had gone stale on three axes at once: the set
had grown 50 → 56 and gained two lanes, and the comparison models (`gpt-4o`,
`gemini-2.5-pro`) were a generation behind the ones the product now offers.
Re-measured against the shipped catalog ([`model-catalog.ts`](../src/llm/model-catalog.ts)),
one run per model, identical prompt and rule, `--context=fixture`,
`JUDGE_INCLUDE_BODY=true` — i.e. the `eval.yml` environment:

| model | overall | urgent recall | silenced precision | $/M in | gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `openai/gpt-5.4` | 56/56 = 100.0% | 13/13 | 100% | $2.50 | pass |
| `google/gemini-3.5-flash` | 55/56 = 98.2% | 13/13 | 100% | $1.50 | pass |
| `google/gemini-2.5-flash` *(default pin)* | 54/56 = 96.4% | 13/13 | 92.3% | $0.30 | pass |
| `x-ai/grok-4.3` | 53/56 = 94.6% | 12/13 | 100% | $1.25 | pass |
| `anthropic/claude-opus-4.8` | 51/56 = 91.1% | 10/13 | 100% | $5.00 | **fail** |
| `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` | 45/56 = 80.4% | 5/13 | 100% | $2.00 | **fail** |

Three findings worth keeping:

1. **"A cheap model beats the frontier" no longer holds and has been retired
   from the README.** `gpt-5.4` scores perfectly. What replaced it is a
   stronger claim anyway: price does not order the table (the $5.00 model
   places fifth), and the spread *among* frontier models (19.6pt) is over five
   times the best-frontier-to-default-pin gap (3.6pt).
2. **`claude-sonnet-5` fails on calibration, not comprehension.** Seven of its
   eight urgent misses cleared `urgency` (0.80–1.00) and failed `confidence`
   (0.55–0.60) against the 0.70 bar in `tier-policy.ts`. It reads the mail and
   then declines to say it is sure. This is exactly the diagnosis a
   model-picks-the-tier design cannot produce.
3. **Safety invariant 1 held for every model.** Across a 19.6-point spread
   including two gate failures, truth-`PUSH` → predicted-`SILENT` was **0** in
   all six runs. Every miss degraded to `QUEUE`.

Instrument integrity for the run: zero items dropped to the keyword fallback,
and every disagreement carried an `[llm]` source tag — so the two failures are
model behaviour, not provider flakiness.

## Real-mail set: the 94.3% expired when INFO shipped (2026-08-26)

`real-eval-set.json` was last touched at #867 and its labels are drawn from the
**three-lane** vocabulary (`PUSH`/`QUEUE`/`SILENT`). The judge has since moved
to five lanes (#1125 foundation, #1138 default-ON). Re-measured on the default
pin, `--context=fixture`, three consecutive runs, byte-identical results each
time:

| run | overall | urgent recall | silenced precision |
|---|---|---|---|
| ×3 | **46/53 = 86.8%** | 3/4 | 95.5% (21/22) |

The README quoted **50/53 = 94.3%** for this set. The gap is fully accounted
for and is *not* a quality regression — **4 of the 7 misses are `QUEUE` →
`INFO`**, a prediction the label vocabulary cannot score as correct because
`INFO` did not exist when the labels were written. 46 + 4 = 50.

The four, judged on their merits rather than on the stale label:

| item | predicted | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| "Thanks for applying to Google" | `INFO` | judge looks right — automated record |
| Reddit digest recommendation | `INFO` | judge looks right — automated record |
| "[GitHub] Please verify your email address." ×2 | `INFO` | **arguable** — a verification link is an action, which argues `QUEUE` |

The remaining three are genuine misses and should stay on the books: one
`QUEUE` → `SILENT` (a product-update mail was hidden), one `QUEUE` → `PUSH` (a
confirmation code interrupted), one `PUSH` → `QUEUE`.

Model and context axes, measured separately so neither is confounded:

| configuration | overall | urgent recall |
|---|---|---|
| `gemini-2.5-flash`, warm (fixture context) | **86.8%** | 3/4 |
| `gpt-5.4`, warm | 84.9% | 3/4 |
| `gemini-3.5-flash`, warm | 77.4% | 3/4 |
| `gemini-2.5-flash`, **cold** (empty context) | 77.4% | 0/4 |

Two things worth noting. First, **synthetic-set performance does not transfer**:
`gpt-5.4` scores 56/56 on the gate set and lands *below* the 8×-cheaper default
pin on real mail. Second, the cold-start PUSH recall of 0/4 reproduces the
behaviour already documented in the 2026-07-16 section above — three of the four
urgent items are `OVERRIDE:PUSH` senders whose prior only exists warm.

**Action required before this set's number is quotable again:** re-label it
against the five-lane ontology. Until that lands, cite 86.8% with the caveat,
or cite the synthetic gate set instead. Do not restore 94.3% — it measures a
judge that no longer exists.

## JUDGE_INCLUDE_BODY measurement (2026-07-20)

`pnpm eval:judge:body` (the 8-item body-dependent set, where from+subject+snippet
deliberately point at the WRONG tier) against claude-sonnet-5 via OpenRouter:

| | body OFF | body ON | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| overall accuracy | 0% | **62.5%** | +62.5pt |
| PUSH recall | 0% | **100%** | +100pt |
| PUSH precision | 0% | **100%** | +100pt |
| QUEUE recall | 0% | 50% | +50pt |

Zero provider errors in either run; the OFF-side zeros are by construction (the
set exists to isolate the body's contribution). Both remaining ON-side misses
(1 SILENT, 1 AUTO) degraded to QUEUE — the safe direction. Conclusion: the flag
stays ON in prod (flipped 2026-07-20); on snippet-misleading mail it is the
difference between missing every PUSH and catching them all.

## Context-channel measurement (2026-07-20)

`pnpm eval:judge:context` (new 8-item context-dependent set — base signals point
at the WRONG tier; truth is recoverable only from the per-item fixture: sender
traits, engagement, tier history — the channels prod gates behind
SENDER_TRAITS_IN_JUDGE / CONTACT_ENGAGEMENT_IN_JUDGE). Body pinned OFF in both
runs so the context contribution is isolated. claude-sonnet-5 via OpenRouter:

| | no context | with context | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| overall accuracy | 37.5% | **50.0%** | +12.5pt |
| PUSH precision | 50% | **100%** | +50pt (urgency-bait stopped interrupting) |
| QUEUE recall | 66.7% | **100%** | +33.3pt (promo-shaped real work rescued) |
| predicted SILENT | — | **0** | never hides non-marketing mail |

The three truth-SILENT items (payment-scare bait, recruiter cold outreach, CI
noise) landed QUEUE even with damning context — the locked "SILENT is narrow:
clear marketing only" rule holds, so the channel's wins come with zero
over-suppression risk. Recommendation recorded here: flip both context flags ON.

## Adding cases

Add cases when you find a real misclassification worth locking in:

1. Reproduce the email **synthetically** — fictional sender/domain, no real
   names, no real addresses. Keep the structural signal (sender pattern,
   subject markers, urgency words), drop the identity.
2. Set `label` to the tier the founder would choose, add a `note` saying why
   it's interesting (e.g. "hard for keyword fallback").
3. Run `npx vitest run src/__tests__/judge-eval-set.test.ts` and
   `pnpm eval:judge` (needs `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`).

## Running against the private ground truth

The original POC measurement still works unchanged:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=... OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... npx tsx scripts/poc-accuracy.ts \
  --in=../../poc-ground-truth.json
```

## Weekly canary: verdict flips + margin erosion (#769)

`judge-canary.yml` re-scores the committed set every Monday and compares the
run against the previous week's baseline with `scripts/canary-compare.ts`:

- **Verdict flip = alarm.** An item present in both runs whose predicted tier
  changed (with an unchanged label) fails the workflow. On a fixed set with a
  temperature-0 judge, a flip means the decision boundary itself moved —
  prompt drift, threshold change, or provider-side model drift. This is the
  signal the PR-gate eval cannot see: it only runs when a PR touches judge
  files, never on an unchanged codebase.
- **Margins = readout.** Per floor check, `value − floor` for both runs and
  the delta, so a floor that is still green but clearing by less every week
  (e.g. PUSH recall 0.92 → 0.91 → 0.901 against a 0.90 floor) is visible
  before the run that finally trips it.

Baseline lifecycle: on a stable run the baseline refreshes (rolling
actions/cache key); on an alarm it is kept, so the flip keeps firing weekly
until investigated. To accept a new normal, run the workflow manually with
`accept-baseline=true`.

## 2026-07-16: real mail is measured on every PR (report-only, ratchet pending)

The judge was measured on **`eval/real-eval-set.json`** — 53 founder-labeled
real emails (18 SILENT / 31 QUEUE / 4 PUSH, 50 with bodies) — for the first
time. Cold-start (no sender context), with role-preserving scrub so the
deterministic sender floors fire:

- **Overall 81.1% (43/53)** — the original POC GO/NO-GO bar (≥80% on real
  mail) PASSES. QUEUE recall 80.6%, SILENT recall 100%.
- **PUSH recall 0/4** — 3 of 4 are the founder's own `OVERRIDE:PUSH` senders
  (waitlist notifications): in prod those overrides form a sender-prior that
  short-circuits to PUSH; the cold-start eval can't see it. The context-aware
  fix is per-item fixtures from the ledger (`--context=fixture`).
- **SILENT precision 78.3%** — newsletters the founder actually reads,
  buried by the generic rule. This is the gap the (dark) engagement flag
  exists to close; these numbers are its flip evidence.

Wiring, until PUSH support matures:
- **`eval.yml`**: the synthetic set stays the GATE; a second
  "Real-mail readout (report-only)" step prints the real numbers on every
  judge PR (a floor breach is a `::warning`, never a fail).
- **`judge-canary.yml`** runs the real set weekly for FLIP detection only —
  floor breaches are expected (warning), drift alarms are not.
- **Warm-start fixtures**: items carry `context` snapshots (senderPrior +
  senderFacts, numeric-only) taken from the production `buildJudgeContext`
  via `--emit-context` — so the readout measures the judge the way prod runs
  it (the founder's OVERRIDE:PUSH priors short-circuit). Re-emit after
  ledger-heavy dogfood stretches.
- **Ratchet condition**: when the regenerated set reaches **PUSH support
  ≥10** (every in-app override/confirm adds ledger rows for the next
  `draft-real-eval-set.ts` run), repoint the gate step at
  `real-eval-set.json` and delete the report-only step.
- The synthetic 50-item set stays committed — the deterministic no-LLM test
  (`judge-eval-set.test.ts`) still pins it.

**The blocker is the data, not the wiring** — and the review step is
deliberately manual. The drafting kit (`scripts/draft-real-eval-set.ts`, #648)
automates everything AROUND that step, never the step itself:

1. **DRAFT** (local, never committed — the output name matches the gitignored
   `poc-*.json` pattern):
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/draft-real-eval-set.ts --user=<founder email> \
     --in=../../poc-ground-truth.json
   ```
   Collects real labeled mail from the POC ground-truth file (bodies joined
   from the DB) **plus** the DecisionLabel ledger (`OVERRIDE:<tier>` /
   `CONFIRM:<tier>` rows — every override/confirm in the app grows this set),
   then mechanically scrubs addresses/URLs/phones with deterministic,
   sender-consistent placeholders (`src/eval-scrub.ts`).
2. **REVIEW** — the founder eyeballs every row: fix names/orgs the patterns
   can't see (each row carries `scrubNotes` showing what was replaced), then
   set `reviewed: true`. This step stays human; an auto-scrubber must never
   commit real mail to a public repo — one missed address is an irreversible
   leak.
3. **FINALIZE + VERIFY**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/draft-real-eval-set.ts \
     --finalize=../../poc-real-eval-set.draft.json --final-out=eval/real-eval-set.json
   npx tsx scripts/draft-real-eval-set.ts --verify=eval/real-eval-set.json
   ```
   Finalize refuses unless every row is `reviewed:true`, strips the review
   fields, and runs the leak-linter; verify is the standalone pre-commit
   tripwire (exit 2 on any address/URL/phone-shaped remnant). Run verify
   before every commit that touches the file.
4. Once committed, flip the `--in=` above. Then "green canary" and "thesis
   proven on real mail" become the **same auditable event** — the whole point
   of the gate.

Keep the deterministic floor + safety invariants identical; only the data set
changes.

## Context modes (#650 — eval runs the judge's real context path)

`poc-accuracy.ts` used to judge every item with `EMPTY_JUDGE_CONTEXT`, so the
context flags (`LEARNED_RULES_IN_JUDGE`, `CONTACT_ENGAGEMENT_IN_JUDGE`,
`SENDER_TRAITS_IN_JUDGE`) were structurally invisible to the eval — an ON/OFF
A/B was a no-op by construction. Three modes close that hole:

| Mode | Flag | What feeds the judge |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fixture` (default) | `--context=fixture` | per-item `context` fixtures from the eval JSON (strictly validated — a typo fails the run); items without one get the empty context, byte-identical to the old eval |
| `empty` | `--context=empty` | forces the empty context — the A/B baseline |
| `db` | `--context=db --user=<email>` | the **production** `buildJudgeContext` against a real `DATABASE_URL` — the offline instrument for measuring a context flag on a real account before flipping it in prod |

A fixture may carry `corrections`, `senderPrior`, `senderFacts`,
`senderTraits`, and `learnedRules` (see `src/eval-context.ts` for the exact
shapes). The CI gate runs with `JUDGE_INCLUDE_BODY=true` to match prod (#653);
this is inert on the committed set until items carry `body` fields (#648).

**db mode requires an UNSCRUBBED input** (`poc-ground-truth.json` or the local
draft) and refuses scrubbed sets. Placeholder senders (`*.example`) resolve to
nothing in the DB, so every sender-scoped channel comes back empty while the
user-scoped correction few-shots still land in every prompt — a context no
real email ever gets. Measured 2026-07-16: the committed set under db mode
scored 69.8% vs 84.9% in fixture mode — pure instrument artifact, not drift.

## Per-tier gating floors

`--gate-floor=auto-recall=0.5,push-recall=0.95` promotes a report-only tier to
a gating check and/or tightens a committed floor. Floors are ratchets: a
default-gating floor (overall, push-recall, silent-precision) can only be set
at or above its committed value; report-only tiers (queue-recall, auto-recall)
may gate at any floor once a stable baseline exists.

## Model canary (#526 — the non-judge surfaces)

`model-canary.yml` (Mondays 02:00 UTC) extends the same flip-alarm machinery to
the models the judge canary cannot see: **chat (`MODEL`)** and
**agent (`AGENT_MODEL`)**, with **vision (`VISION_MODEL`) via manual dispatch**
(its default pin is a `:free` SKU whose quota flakiness would false-alarm a
schedule). These have no ground-truth labels, so instead of accuracy floors the
probe set (`src/llm/model-canary-probes.ts`) mixes:

- **objective probes** — micro-tasks with one canonical answer (arithmetic,
  extraction, date math, logic) → a report-only accuracy readout, and
- **fingerprint probes** — tasks with many valid answers where a
  temperature-0 model makes a stable idiosyncratic choice → a different model
  behind the same SKU id almost certainly picks differently.

Any answer flip on an identical probe fails the workflow (same
`scripts/canary-compare.ts`, same baseline lifecycle and
`accept-baseline=true` procedure as the judge canary).

## Bake-off re-measured with variance (2026-09-04 — 10 models × 3 runs)

The 2026-08-26 table above ranked six models on one run each. A reader
objected that on 56 items every 1.8pt is a single email, so single-run
ordering is noise; re-measuring confirmed that for the middle of the table
and refuted it for the ends. Two further defects were found in the 08-26 run
while doing so: it benchmarked the product's chat catalog (pinned 2026-07-04)
and so missed `gemini-3.7-flash`, `grok-4.6` and the `gpt-5.6` family, all of
which predated it; and it described itself as temperature-0 when the judge
sets no temperature at all (provider default — which is what production runs,
so that is what is measured here).

Configuration: `--context=fixture`, `JUDGE_INCLUDE_BODY=true`, concurrency 1,
3s pacing. **Any run in which an item fell back to the keyword path was
discarded**, not averaged — a fallback verdict measures the fallback, not the
model. 23 of 30 planned runs survived; the sweep also shared an API key with
production and briefly rate-limited it (see klorn-ops `incidents/`), which is
why eval now requires a dedicated key.

| model | runs | correct / 56 | range | urgent / 13 | gate | PUSH→SILENT |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `openai/gpt-5.4` | 3 | 56 · 56 · 56 | 100.0 | 13 · 13 · 13 | 3/3 | 0 |
| `google/gemini-3.5-flash` | 3 | 55 · 55 · 55 | 98.2 | 13 · 13 · 13 | 3/3 | 0 |
| `openai/gpt-5.6-terra` | 2 | 55 · 55 | 98.2 | 13 · 13 | 2/2 | 0 |
| `x-ai/grok-4.6` | 1 | 55 | 98.2 | 12 | 1/1 | 0 |
| `google/gemini-3.7-flash` | 3 | 55 · 55 · 54 | 96.4–98.2 | 13 · 13 · 12 | 3/3 | 0 |
| `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` | 2 | 53 · 55 | 94.6–98.2 | 12 · 12 | 2/2 | 0 |
| `google/gemini-2.5-flash` *(default pin)* | 3 | 54 · 54 · 54 | 96.4 | 13 · 13 · 13 | 3/3 | 0 |
| `x-ai/grok-4.3` | 2 | 54 · 54 | 96.4 | 12 · 12 | 2/2 | 0 |
| `anthropic/claude-opus-4.8` | 2 | 50 · 49 | 87.5–89.3 | 9 · 8 | 0/2 | 0 |
| `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` | 2 | 48 · 45 | 80.4–85.7 | 7 · 5 | 0/2 | 0 |

`grok-4.6` lost two runs to upstream timeouts exceeding 90 minutes each; that
is an availability finding about the provider, recorded here rather than
smoothed over, and it disqualifies the model as a judge pin regardless of its
one clean score.

Findings that survive three runs: (1) the 98.2 cluster is a tie and must be
reported as a tier; (2) gpt-5.4 at 56/56 and both Anthropic models below the
urgent floor are stable, so the ends of the table are real; (3) price still
does not order the table — the $0.20 model reaches the top tier and the $5.00
model never passes; (4) at provider-default temperature 8 of 10 models moved
≤1 email between runs and the two that moved 2–3 are the two failing the gate,
so run-to-run stability is itself a selection criterion for a per-email judge;
(5) safety invariant 1 held in all 23 runs. The sonnet-5 confidence-vs-urgency
mechanism reproduced across runs (urgent 5–7/13) with the same shape.

> ⚠️ The canary sections above describe the judge as temperature-0. It is not — `createCompletion` passes no `temperature`, so the judge runs at each provider's default. The 09-04 measurement shows most models are still stable run-to-run at that default, but the canary's flip-alarm reasoning assumes determinism it does not have. Tracked in #1297.
