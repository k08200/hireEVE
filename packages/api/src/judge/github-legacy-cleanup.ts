/**
 * One-shot cleanup for the removed GitHub notifications integration.
 *
 * The poller is gone, but the AttentionItems it already wrote are not — and
 * nothing auto-resolves them, so without this they would sit on the firewall
 * board forever competing with real mail for its recency window (the exact
 * starvation that froze the board in 2026-08). The old disconnect route used
 * to do this, but only for users who clicked disconnect.
 *
 * Idempotent and self-retiring: after the first successful pass every
 * subsequent boot updates zero rows. Runs once per process at startup,
 * fire-and-forget. The Prisma enum keeps its GITHUB member on purpose —
 * Postgres cannot drop an enum value while rows reference it, and the
 * historical DecisionLabel ledger still does.
