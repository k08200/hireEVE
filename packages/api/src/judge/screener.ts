/**
 * Screener — the first-contact gate.
 *
 * HEY's Screener and Spark's Gatekeeper both answer a question Klorn's ladder
 * never asked: *should this person be able to reach me at all?* Everything in
 * `poc-judge.judgeEmail` assumes the sender is already legitimate and only
 * argues about which lane they land in. For a sender you have never heard from,
 * that is the wrong first question, and answering it with a model call costs
 * money on exactly the mail where the model has the least evidence.
 *
 * Two deliberate limits, both doctrine rather than convenience:
 *
 *   1. **No sixth lane.** `product-vocabulary.md` fixes the list at five, and a
 *      screener is not a lane — it is a decision *about a sender*. A BLOCK is
 *      written as a `PIN_TIER -> SILENT` rule, which the judge already honours
 *      at rank 0, above even the marketing fast-path. Nothing new to enforce.
 *
 *   2. **Nothing is held.** HEY parks unscreened mail until you rule on it. If
 *      you ignore Klorn's screener, mail still gets classified and delivered
 *      exactly as it does today; the screener only ever *adds* a permanent
 *      shortcut. A gate that can silently strand mail is a worse failure than
 *      the noise it prevents.
 *
 * Off by default behind `SCREENER_ENABLED`, per the flag doctrine in CLAUDE.md.
