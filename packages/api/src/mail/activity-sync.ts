/**
 * Activity-driven mail pull.
 *
 * The scheduler's per-user email sync sits behind gates a user can silently
 * fall out of — most sharply, a user with NO AutomationConfig row is never in
 * the scheduler's loop at all. With Gmail push unconfigured there is then no
 * second path and mail simply stops with no in-app signal.
 *
 * Scope, stated honestly: this fixes the GATE-FALLOUT class only. A dead or
 * revoked OAuth token (invalid_grant) still needs the user to reconnect —
 * that path is surfaced by /api/email/inboxes needsReconnect and the
 * clients' reconnect affordance, not repaired here.
 *
 * Cadence caveat: the desktop client polls on a timer whether or not anyone
 * is looking, so for it this is closer to "signed in" than "active". It is
 * therefore opt-OUT-able without a deploy (ACTIVITY_MAIL_SYNC_DISABLED) and
 * respects the user's own emailAutoClassify toggle.
 *
 * Deliberately its own module: the firewall read path must not statically
 * import the whole ingestion graph (googleapis, judge, persist) just to fire
 * a background pull. syncEmails is loaded on demand, inside the try.
