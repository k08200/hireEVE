/**
 * The judge's `reason` is shown to the user as "why this was PUSH", so it has
 * to be in a language they read. It was free-form English with no instruction
 * about language at all, which put an English sentence inside the Korean UI's
 * "%@인 이유 · %@" template — one line, two languages.
 *
 * This locks the WIRING: a dropped argument anywhere in
 * judgeAndMirrorEmail → judgeEmail → extractWithDial → extractFeaturesWithLlm
 * → buildJudgePrompt would still type-check, so only an end-to-end prompt
 * assertion catches it. createCompletion is mocked and its prompt captured.
