/**
 * Daily digest — the safety net for everything Klorn filed away.
 *
 * SILENT and INFO are the lanes that make the firewall worth having, and they
 * are also the only ones the user cannot check by glancing at their inbox.
 * "Filed, not deleted" is a promise, and a promise nobody can audit is just an
 * assertion. SaneBox has shipped a daily digest since 2010 for exactly this
 * reason: it is the mechanism that makes suppression trustworthy.
 *
 * Distinct from the weekly signal report on purpose:
 *
 *   - The weekly report answers *how did triage go* — measured lane counts,
 *     corrections, auto-actions — and it goes out as a push.
 *   - This answers *did you hide something I needed*, names the senders, and
 *     goes out as EMAIL. Email is the one channel that reaches a user with no
 *     app open and no push permission granted, which is the whole point of a
 *     safety net.
 *
 * Both are digest-class content, so both are governed by the single
 * `daily_briefing` preference rather than growing a second switch.
 *
 * No LLM and no estimates. The weekly report deliberately refuses to claim
 * "time saved" because we do not measure it; the same rule applies here.
 *
 * Copy is en/ko only, and every other notification language falls back to
 * English. Klorn ships seven; writing five more sets of user-facing email copy
 * unreviewed would be worse than an honest fallback, so the remaining
 * translations go through the normal i18n lane rather than being invented here.
 *
 * Off by default behind `DAILY_DIGEST_ENABLED`.
