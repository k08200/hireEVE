/**
 * Per-user daily LLM cost gate.
 *
 * Wraps every paid LLM call. Reads the `LlmCostLedger` row for today,
 * compares against `DAILY_COST_CAP_CENTS`, and blocks the call once the
 * cap is exceeded. Successful calls increment the ledger.
 *
 * The previous code path only logged `estimateModelCostUsd()` — no hard
 * stop. A single runaway agent loop could rack up real money. With this
 * gate the worst case is one over-the-cap call (the one that crosses the
 * threshold), then every subsequent call short-circuits.
 *
 * Free models (cost = 0) still flow through here so we record the
 * `callCount` and `lastModel` for visibility, but they never trip the cap.
