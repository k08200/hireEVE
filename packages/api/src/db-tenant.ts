/**
 * Tenant-scoped and system-scoped query execution for Postgres Row-Level
 * Security.
 *
 * RLS is enabled (not FORCEd) on every per-user table, and is inert today: the
 * app connects as `postgres`, which both owns the tables and carries the
 * BYPASSRLS attribute (measured 2026-08-04). Ownership alone would be fixable
 * with FORCE; BYPASSRLS is not — it outranks FORCE, so no amount of forcing
 * makes these policies evaluate while the app connects as that role.
 *
 * What activates them is connecting as a dedicated least-privilege role that
 * owns nothing and has no BYPASSRLS. Plain ENABLE constrains a non-owner role,
 * so at that point the existing migration is already sufficient. These helpers
 * bind the request's tenant context now so that switch needs no second code
 * change. See docs/rls-rollout.md for the staged plan and its ordering hazard
 * (the switch arms every table at once; unrouted queries return zero rows
 * rather than erroring).
 *
 * Mechanism: an interactive transaction with `set_config(name, value, true)`.
 * The `is_local = true` third arg scopes the GUC to the transaction, so it can
 * never leak across a pooled (PgBouncer transaction-mode) connection — the one
 * pattern that is pooler-safe. Every query inside must use the passed `tx`
 * handle; a query issued on the global `prisma` client runs in its own
 * connection without the GUC and (once RLS binds) sees zero rows.
 *
 * Policies OR two permissive rules: `"userId" = app.current_user_id` (tenant)
 * and `app.bypass_rls = 'on'` (system). withSystem is for the paths that have
 * no single tenant — schedulers, webhook ingest, admin fleet queries.
 *
 * ## Why the transaction is skipped while RLS is inert
 *
 * That transaction exists only to carry a GUC. While the connected role
 * bypasses RLS no policy ever reads that GUC, so the wrapper buys nothing and
 * costs `BEGIN` + `set_config` + `COMMIT` — three extra round trips, measured
 * at 3.7x a bare query (11.5 ms → 42.1 ms) and ~+190 ms from the API's region,
 * which is ~4,700 km from the database. Paying that for a no-op is what made
 * routing the remaining call sites look unaffordable; it is not the routing
 * that is expensive, it is wrapping ahead of the switch. So these helpers
 * detect whether RLS can actually constrain the connected role and skip the
 * transaction when it cannot. Routing a call site is then free until the role
 * switches, and the cost arrives together with the isolation it buys.
 *
 * The tradeoff is worth stating plainly: while inert the callback receives the
 * global client, so a query that wrongly uses `prisma` instead of the passed
 * handle behaves identically and stays invisible until the switch. Tests run
 * with the wrapper forced on (`RLS_ENFORCEMENT=on`, vitest.config.ts) so that
 * discipline is still enforced where it can be observed.
