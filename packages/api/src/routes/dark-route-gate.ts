/**
 * onRequest hook that makes every route in a plugin answer Fastify's default
 * 404 — byte-for-byte (fastify/lib/four-oh-four.js) — while `gate()` is
 * false. Used for provider surfaces that must stay dark until their flag
 * flips (CASA surface freeze): a dark route has to be indistinguishable from
 * a route that doesn't exist, even to an unauthenticated probe, and a static
 * "Not Found" body would let a scanner diff it against a truly unregistered
 * sibling. onRequest (not preHandler) so it fires before any auth hook.
